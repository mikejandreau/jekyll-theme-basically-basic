You've finally decided that you want/need a website for your business, brand, or blog. Where do you go from there?

There are two main directions you can take from this point - doing it yourself, or hiring someone to do it for you. 

Building a website can be a complicated venture, and this is the first of many choices you have before you get to the launch phase. 

Each phase can branch off to a different route, and when it comes down to it, the possibilities are virtually endless. The only limitations are needs, time-line, and budget.

So let's break it down into three top-level steps.



Step 1: Purpose
------------

What is the purpose for making this site? The answer may seem obvious, but give it some thought, as it will inform every decision made from this point forward. Your content is the product of your purpose. 

Let's say you own a restaurant and you want to have people eat there and have a good time. The purpose of your website should be to tell people what food you serve, when specials/events you have, when you're open, how to book a reservation, and where you are located. 

Providing that information to potential customers is your purpose, and anything else is extra.



Step 2: Content
------------

Now that we have the purpose for creating the site, we can begin creating and editing the content.

Using the restaurant example, let's create a basic sitemap, or outline of your site's pages.

We'll probably want a contact page with a form and phone number, maybe an "about" page with a brief history of the company and staff, a page for the food and drinks on the menu, and a page for special events. We'll make a page for the food and drinks on the menu, and maybe some featured specials of the day/week on the homepage. Things like hours, phone number, and directions can be put on a contact page. It may be good to have a separate page for events or community calendar to let people know about events that may interest them, like concerts and trivia nights. 

So our basic sitemap is this: Home, Menu, Events, Contact, and maybe a Call/Reservation link. From that, we can create some content for each page to use in the next step, where we design the presentation of this information.



Step 3: Design
------------

Now that we have our purpose and (ideally) all of the content, we can get started on the design.

> **Note:** This is a guide for website design specifically. Branding is a topic that deserves its own post, and for the purpose of this guide, we will assume you already have a logo and branding.

Let's begin with arranging the logo, navigation, and other elements. Modern websites should be responsive, so here's where we decide how the navigation will appear across devices. Here's a basic sample of smartphone, tablet, and computer layouts:

**IMAGES OF LAYOUTS**
Mobile layout
Mobile layout with menu expanded
Tablet layout
Laptop/Desktop layout

I've worked on projects where I was asked to get straight to the design without the purpose determined or the content assembled. Starting without even a basic sitemap is ultimately an exercise in wasting time. 

It's been said that necessity is the mother of invention - when faced with a problem, we work to find solutions to solve it. We don't start creating solutions without knowing what problem we're trying to solve. Similarly, starting with design without any content or purpose is essentially staring with the solution without knowing the problem you're trying to solve. 

If necessity is the mother of invention, purpose is the mother of design.
